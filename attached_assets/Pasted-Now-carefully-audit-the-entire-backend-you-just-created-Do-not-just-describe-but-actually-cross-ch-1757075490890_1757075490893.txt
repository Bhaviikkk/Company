Now carefully audit the entire backend you just created. Do not just describe, but actually cross-check each critical component to ensure it is implemented correctly, production-ready, and aligned with our requirements. Go through these specific points one by one:

Scrapers – Verify that scrapers for SC/NCLT/NCLAT are not placeholders. Ensure they:

Handle pagination, rate limits, and deduplication (via hashing).

Respect robots.txt and retry failed requests.

Normalize extracted text into a consistent schema.

Database – Confirm PostgreSQL/CockroachDB models include proper indexes for search (court, section, date). Add Alembic migrations if missing. Check connection pooling for scalability.

Summarisation Agents – Verify LangChain + Gemini multi-agent system is really working:

Summariser outputs strictly structured JSON (issues, holding, reasoning, citations).

Validator agent cross-checks against source text (not just re-prompts).

Accuracy/grounding score is computed numerically (≥95%).

Search Engine – Confirm if search uses Postgres text search or Typesense/Meilisearch. For scalability, implement proper search indexing and snippet generation.

Celery + Workers – Ensure Celery tasks run independently of the API server, with a separate worker entrypoint. Confirm Redis integration is working for task queueing.

Storage Layer – Confirm S3-compatible storage (or Supabase) integration is working with signed URL access, not just local storage.

API Endpoints – Test each endpoint (/premium-research, /bulk-analysis, /multi-agent-analysis, etc.) with sample docs. Validate response structure, pagination, and error handling.

Quality Assurance – Ensure summaries below 95% grounding score are flagged for human review. Build admin endpoints for approving/rejecting flagged summaries.

Security – Verify JWT-based authentication for ingestion/admin endpoints. Add rate limiting to public endpoints.

Testing – Scaffold pytest tests for ingestion, summarisation, and search endpoints. Ensure CI tests can run locally or in Replit.

Finally, after this audit, fix or upgrade any weak spots you find, so the system is genuinely robust, production-ready, and capable of handling real Company Secretary research needs. Do not exaggerate — only claim features that are fully implemented and tested. Where possible, provide logs or test outputs to prove correctness.
